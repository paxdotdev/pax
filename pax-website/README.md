# Pax website

The first-party Pax application lives at root-level `pax-website/`, beside the
static Zola site in [`pax-blog/`](../pax-blog/README.md). It is not a reusable CLI
example or a publishable crate. The monorepo explicitly excludes it from its
Cargo workspace so the site's standalone profiles remain effective: development
dependencies use optimization level 1; the website application uses level 0.

## Local development

From the monorepo root on this workstation:

```sh
source ~/.zshrc
nvm use
./pax-website/pax run --target web
```

The launcher builds this checkout's CLI, selects the website by its own location
(not the invoking working directory), and uses `--libdev`. The equivalent direct
command is:

```sh
cargo run -p pax-cli -- run --path pax-website --target web --libdev
```

For an optimized web build without serving or publishing:

```sh
./pax-website/pax build --target web --release
```

Debug and release outputs live in `.pax/build/debug/web/` and
`.pax/build/release/web/` beneath this directory. Generated `.pax/`, `target/`,
`Cargo.lock`, AI-primer HTML, and staged blog previews stay untracked.

The hero imports `AnimatedPaxLogo` directly from `examples/src/pax-logo/` and
includes the original component sources for View Source. Living Quilt remains
independently runnable in `examples/src/living-quilt/`, but is no longer mounted
or a website dependency. No duplicate implementation or standard-library
migration is needed. Cargo dependency paths
and favicon paths are relative to this manifest; Rust `include_str!` paths are
relative to their source file.

## Website and blog boundary

The website declares `/blog`, `/ai`, and `/ai.md` as `server_owned_prefixes`.
Navigating to these paths loads a server document instead of a Pax client route.
The `/blog/*` Router placeholder must not be restored. `build.rs` generates
`public/ai/index.html` from `public/ai.md` only when its contents change.

To check the separate blog locally, follow its setup instructions, start the
website, and use the website's printed port:

```sh
python3 pax-blog/blog.py stage --port <website-port>
```

This is a draft preview, generated into `pax-website/public/blog/`. It is not
production output. Remove it before a website release intended for publication:

```sh
python3 pax-blog/blog.py unstage
python3 pax-blog/blog.py build
```

The second command independently builds production blog files, excluding drafts,
into `pax-blog/public/`. Neither command deploys anything. Website publication
must exclude `blog` and `blog/*` from root uploads, including deletion, while blog
uploads remain scoped to `s3://www.pax.dev/blog/`. The publisher and production
acceptance are still pending; see the [hosting handoff](../pax-blog/infra/README.md).

The website's source is inspected in the running site, not through the CLI's
bundled `examples/` catalog. After moving or changing reusable examples, refresh
that separate snapshot with `python3 scripts/sync-docs-examples.py`.
