# Pain points — raw findings inbox

This is a temporary intake for findings encountered during work, not a reference
or a prerequisite for agents to read before starting a task.

Add concise, dated reports: what you tried, expected versus observed behavior,
reproduction steps or evidence, relevant target/revision, and any workaround or
related Linear issue. Link repeated reports instead of copying long journals.

Periodically triage the inbox: discard resolved or obsolete findings, preserve
ongoing issues and report details in Pax Core Linear tickets, and remove each
processed entry. Keep only exceptional proactive guidance in `AGENTS.md`.
Design exploration and specifications belong directly in Linear, not here.

Last triaged: 2026-10-05 — [PAX-972](https://linear.app/paxdev/issue/PAX-972/pay-down-the-pain-pointsmd-file).

## Untriaged findings

## 2026-10-06 — macOS display-link startup

A macOS example can open a blank window if CoreVideo reports
`CVDisplayLinkCreateWithCGDisplays error -6661` with an active display count of
zero. In the Scroll Matrix smoke test, relaunching after the display became
available restored rendering without source changes. Inspect the app's system
log before treating an idle blank window as a renderer regression. The current
display-link setup does not retry that startup failure automatically.

- 2026-10-11, shader-studio / PAX-1035: PAXEL does not accept Rust method calls
  such as `self.phase.sin()`. Expose a `#[helpers]` associated function and call
  `Landscape::sun_x(self.phase)`; grouped units work as `{(Landscape::sun_x(self.phase))%}`.
  Numeric literals need a fractional digit (`24.0`, not `24.`). Frame's
  `corner_radius` is `f64`, so use `18`, not `18px` (the latter warns and keeps
  the default).
- 2026-10-11, shader-studio web debug build: a fresh resolution to Pest 2.9.3
  introduced the psm Wasm stack helper. macOS `ar`/`ranlib` warned that `wasm32.o`
  was not Mach-O; the emitted JS imported unresolved `env::rust_psm_stack_pointer`
  and the browser stayed blank. Install Rust's official `llvm-tools-preview`
  component and set `AR_wasm32_unknown_unknown` to that toolchain's `llvm-ar`
  for the web build. This links the real helper and removes the `env` import.
- 2026-10-11, shader-studio / PAX-1035: `pax-cli dev look` places the styled
  mode-button labels at the upper left, although the live browser centers them
  with `TextAlignHorizontal::Center` and `TextAlignVertical::Center`. Reproduce
  with the example's `.mode_button` class and compare a dev-look PNG to a browser
  screenshot. Use the browser to judge native-control alignment; the capture
  remains useful for inspecting GPU brush pixels. After hot reload and scrolling,
  dev-look captures also showed native buttons/sliders duplicated at old positions
  while the live browser remained correct.
