    Update init logic, two manifests, two designtimes on other side of serialization
    
    git checkout main  # or the branch where pax-designtime exists
    git subtree split -P pax-designtime -b temp-pax-designtime



if weâ€™re in main and designtime
(AND this is not PaxDesigner itself â€” note that this code will be included in #[main] logic,
which weâ€™ll have at least two of: userland and designer)
then parse PaxDesigner to manifest alongside parsing the userland component tree
deserialize, then
initialize a definition_to_instance_traverser from each manifest (each of which surfaces a get_main_component)
the <PaxFrame> component just traverses this singular boundary (register-ed) for now; can make extensible later with different cartridges
the root component for the engine should be PaxDesigner; the inner component is the userland component


**Dev harness:**

*TL;DR examples should just work the same as `designer-project`*

Would be nice to have a dev harness mechanism for pax-designer through this flow.  I.e. similar to
the designer-project flow we have today.  We seem to lose this because we're retiring designer-project

In fact, given the current setup with relative paths inside the monorepo, we might get this for
free with all existing examples.

They use a relative path for pax-engine, which uses a relative path for pax-designer,
which will thus recompile and update as we libdev.

    draft of macro init logic


[ ] Init logic
    [x] Macro init logic (compiletime)
        [x] Issue: can't export pax_engine::pax_designer (circ. ref., because pax-designer depends on pax-engine)
            - could import pax-designer directly from userland, but adds to boilerplate
                seems most viable so far â€” maybe even correct to require `pax-designer` as a dev dependency when you intend to use it.
                we can handle generating this boilerplate for new projects, and carefully document it.  
                ^ trying the above
                now hitting an issue where the `pax_designer` crate (as generated by macro) doesn't exist within the `pax_designer` crate
                one possibility is to detect at macro-time whether we're in a whitelisted crate
            - could pre-parse pax-designer to manifest, including the manifest string as a compiler artifact (string constant)
                then at init-time, instead of parsing pax-designer to manifest, just load the string
                [Problem] this works for parsing â€” but it seems we will still need pax_designer in the module tree at runtime (probably build-time, too)
                so that e.g. event handlers & properties are present.
                This further suggests figuring out a way to reexport pax_designer through pax_engine, if possible...
            [-] could not import pax_engine inside pax_designer; instead directly reach into all reexported packages
                would enforce that pax_engine is a nice thin wrapper; nothing contained directly
                ^ going to give this a shot...
                [Nope], this tangles with the assumption that `pax_engine` exists at macro-time, which would break #[pax] inside
                pax-designer.  (could parameterize this symbol, but more complexity, esp. in generated cartridge)
            [-] could we bundle designer under pax-std?  The source of the circ ref is pax_designer -> pax_engine -> pax_designer, so [the issue remains]
            [-] what about a new crate: pax-engine-without-designer.  pax-designer depends on this.  it is the current pax-engine crate.
                then pax-engine pub uses the above crate, as well as pax-designer
                finally, userland depends on pax-engine, and gets both crates

        Hypothesis: workspace is failing to build, and this is causing spurious errors
            - get workspace building,
            - come back and try `cargo run --bin=parser --features=parser,designtime` on fireworks

        rn pax-chassis-web has designtime OFF
        and pax-runtime has designtime ON
        start in fireworks, track down flags & deps; see who's breaking the chain

        [Solution] â€” default = ["designtime"] was added to pax-engine/Cargo.toml; was causing break
        [Solution cont.] â€” remove pax-designer from root workspace; enables building workspace without `--features designtime`
    
    [x] Issue: we are including cartridge.partial.rs across every #[main], which e.g. causes build of pax-designer to fail
        when running Fireworks.

        Drafted solution:
            [x] detect whether we are in the root crate of this build.
            [x] might be able to store a static mutable Option<root_crate_pkg_name>, a write-once-read-many (WORM) signal to the rest of the build.
            [x] in the stpl template, check this signal and only include the partial if we are in the root crate. 
                [-] This might be fragile if somehow different versions of pax-macro are included in a build (is that possible or does cargo prevent it?) Answer: cargo prevents it. (answer ft. copilot)

        Note: as of current state, building without designtime requires omitting pax-designer as dependency. 
                might want to rewrap pax-engine-without-designer and pax-engine in another crate after all, to ease ergo here? (consolidating flags:  --feature=designer) 
                ^ this can happen in another pass after big merge

        Success for this stretch will look like: can build fireworks and hopefully even run it; expected runtime crash

        Looks like there's an issue with `IS_DESIGNTIME_BUILD` definition â€” checking cfg within pax-compiler likely won't be useful.
        Probably should pass a runtime flag via CLI instead.
        ^ Resolved this but still hitting
        ```
        6 | #[pax]
        | ^^^^^^ use of undeclared crate or module `pax_designer`
        ```
        This is despite the fact that we're including pax_designer in the root crate.  Could it be because (a) the crate is failing to build,
        or (b) there's some corruption of features, or (c) because pax_designer isn't present in the workspace, even though it's available via the relative path specified in the root project's Cargo.toml?

    [x] Compiler-side: deserialization updates (Vec<PaxManifest>)

    [x] achieve build and run (cargo config, parser, etc.)
        `error[E0433]: failed to resolve: use of undeclared crate or module `pax_designer`
        
        perhaps pax_designer is not being exported or `pub use`? (it seems to be doing so correctly)

        `cd pax-designer && cargo build --features=parser` fails:
        ```
        warning: `pax-designer` (lib) generated 1 warning
        error[E0601]: `main` function not found in crate `parser`
        --> src/lib.rs:163:2
        |
        163 | }
        |  ^ consider adding a `main` function to `src/lib.rs`
        ```

        Clue: running `cargo run --features=parser` fails on pax-designer.  Digging through output, found this error:
        Location: [35m/Users/zack/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/pax-compiler-0.22.0/src/lib.rs
        
        Which suggests there's a place we're pulling a local crate from crates.io instead of via fs path!
        There are no apparent violations in Cargo.tomls, from what I can find

        What apparently finally resolved this was the combo of: 1. fixing a double newline in the .stpl, which was breaking a feature flag cfg macro, and 2. running cargo update

        BUT we still have the `pax_designer` import issue `failed to resolve: use of undeclared crate or module `pax_designer``

        signing off for the day aug 14 2024 with a victory: achieved build of fireworks + designtime; it also runs (rendering only userland component, not designer); now must manage runtime init with the two definitiontoinstancetraversers
                
    [ ] Engine init logic (runtime)
        [ ] for designtime builds, register both definitiontoinstancetraversers with engine on init
        [ ] for designtime builds, render the root component via the designer; register the userland component for paxiframe

    [ ] run design_server instead of static server

    [ ] Module cleanup pass
        [ ] pax_main
            engine
                api
                manifest
                etc.
            designer
            pub use pax_engine::* ???
        [ ] shuttle feature flags:  features=["designer"] => designtime feat + dynamic deps
