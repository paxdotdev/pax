# CONTRIBUTING

We warmly welcome contributions!  Pax is free and open source software, licensed MIT / Apache 2.0.

### Running the monorepo
Follow the *workstation* (e.g. macOS, Linux) and *target* (e.g. WebAssembly, macOS app) setup instructions here: https://docs.pax.dev/start-creating-a-project.html

The examples are an appropriate testbed for developing the monorepo.  Any pending changes to e.g. `pax-runtime` will be reflected
when running examples.  You can run any of the examples with the root monorepo command `cargo run --example fireworks`, or from inside one of the example directories you can use the bash script CLI surrogate: `cd examples/src/fireworks && ./pax run --target=web`

### Communicating with our team
We strongly recommend re aching out to our team on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Eq8KWAUc6b) before embarking on any substantial contributions, in
case your work overlaps or conflicts with our roadmap.
